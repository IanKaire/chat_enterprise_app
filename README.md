## Introduction
This was my third project in Maseno University. It is basically a web application that consolidates communication within one organization, and Kenya Seed Company based in Kitale and Kakamega was my subject of study 

It is a full Realtime Chat Application. I used React on the front end, NodeJS on the back end and the entire chat is powered with https://getstream.io/


## Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
